# ExpandedMenuView
Expanded Menu View library

For one application, I had to develop such a menu, so I decided to share it with everyone

### Usage

Reference the library from your module's build.gradle:

``` gradle
dependencies {
    [...]
    implementation 'com.github.luksoral:ExpandedMenuView:[latest_version]'
}
```
